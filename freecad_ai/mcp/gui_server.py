"""Process-wide controller for the MCP server hosted inside FreeCAD.

Three routes start this server, and all of them land in the same process:

  * ``FreeCAD.AppImage /path/to/mcp_server_http.py`` on the command line
  * ``exec(open(".../mcp_server_http.py").read())`` in the Python console
  * the FreeCAD AI toolbar toggle

They must share one object. Without it the toggle renders unchecked next to a
server that is already listening, and clicking it builds a second transport
that dies on EADDRINUSE inside a daemon thread — visible only as a console
traceback. Port-probing is not a substitute: "something is listening on 3000"
does not mean it is ours.
